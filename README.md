# Robin's Personal Site

A website to list my skills and accomplishments.

Powered with Hugo Static Site Generator

To deploy, make sure the Hugo binary is installed on the server.

    //Example in Dreamhost
    git clone <this repo url> robinforest.net
    cd robinforest.net
    hugo

The static files get generated into the `public/` folder.
