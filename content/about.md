## Education

**Case Western Reserve University**
| B.S. Computer Science

Computer programming has been my passion ever since I was a kid. I began programming on a TI-82 graphing calculator, and then started writing simple programs using FoxPro on my dad's computer.

I took a Visual Basic course in high school, and that set the stage for the rest of my career.  I got accepted into Case Western Reserve University and majored in Computer Science. My coursework included the subjects:

* Data structures and algorithms
* Object oriented programming in Java and C++
* Computer Architecture
* Project Management
* Video game design

I graduated with honors in 2009, and obtained my Bachelor's of Science. Shortly after, I was offered a job with **Bloomberg L.P.** in New York City.

## Hobbies

### Juggling

I stumbled across a juggling club during my first few weeks at CWRU.  I picked up three ball juggling very quickly, and then learned about this prop called **diabolo**.  I fell in love with the prop and still practice it to this day.  I can now run a 3 diabolo shuffle, and juggle up to five balls.

I have performed my diabolo routine at:

* Juggling Festivals: Rochester, NYC and Philadelphia
* Universities: CWRU and Binghamton University
* Parks: Bryant Park, Central Park in NYC.

### Photography

I learned how to use a DSLR a few years back, and have since fallen in love with photography.  I like hiking and photographing the scenery.  Check out my photos:
