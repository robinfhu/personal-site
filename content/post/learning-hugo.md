I'm expanding my horizons and learning more about different front end technologies.
One tool that caught my attention was a static site generator called 'Hugo'.
I decided to give it a try!

## First Thoughts

My original goal was to build my own personal website from scratch, using a Javascript framework like Vue.js or React, along with a Material Design CSS framework.  I wanted to use it as an opportunity to learn a new front end technology.

During my research, I came across the concept of static site generation. The concept piqued my interest, because I originally wanted to build something similar.  I planned to use JSON files to store my content, and then write a Javascript front end to dynamically render the content.  I didn't want to deal with MySQL databases.

I learned about a tool called **Jekyll**, and it's twin **Hugo**.  I chose Hugo because it has a Windows build.  I still use Windows to develop, so this was important!  I spent all day reading the Hugo documentation and playing around with a tutorial app.  It was very fast and easy to start up!

Next, I had to choose an appropriate theme.  Hugo doesn't ship with a theme out of the box, so you need to choose one.  The Hugo website has a [library of themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/), and it was hard to pick the right one.  Ultimately I realized that themes are totally customizable, and I have the power to alter them the way I like.  The content of the site is more important.

## Themes

The theme I ultimately chose was [tranquilpeak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme).  I'm a sucker for beautiful background images, so that was an important feature I wanted.  I also loved the responsive sidebar!  The template is simple and easy to customize.  I got excited about the cover image, and went outside in the rain to take a bokeh photo.

## Future Plans

I want to use this website to showcase some personal software projects and to write down some thoughts.  There are lots of things I'd like to write about: programming, photography, juggling, diabolo and more.  So stay tuned!
